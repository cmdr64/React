Let's use this project to learn react!

So far I'm using class based components, which I believe is somewhat out of style (though it still works perfectly fine)

Objectives

- [x] Create Basic React Components
- [x] Use Expressions to Bind to state
- [ ] Modify it such that user can modify the state variable and see the UI update
