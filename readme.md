Let's use this project to learn react!

So far I'm using class based components, which I believe is somewhat out of style (though it still works perfectly fine)

Objectives

- [x] Create Basic React Components
- [x] Use Expressions to Bind to state
- [ ] Modify it such that user can modify data and see changes
- [x] Make it look pretty good
- [ ] Experiment with useState
- [ ] Experiment with useEffect
- [ ] Experiment with eseContext
